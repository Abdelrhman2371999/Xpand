We need a comprehensive project that integrates several topics. The idea is to set up a Windows Server with AD DS, DNS, and DHCP. Then, create a database on a Linux server. The main requirement is to have the Linux machine successfully join the Windows Active Directory domain. This project should also include a "Script Case".
